a young Grigori Rasputin is asked by his father and a group of men to perform magic.
Rasputin has a vision and denounces one of the men as a horse thief. Although his
father initially slaps him for making such an accusation, Rasputin watches as the
man is chased outside and beaten. Twenty years later, Rasputin sees a vision of
the Virgin Mary, prompting him to become a priest. Rasputin quickly becomes famous,
